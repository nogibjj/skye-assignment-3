## Overview

This project analyzes urban air quality and its impact on public health using data from various sources. The main components of this project include data processing, visualization, and generating reports. The project utilizes Python libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `ydata_profiling` to profile, analyze, and visualize the dataset.


## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/urban-air-quality.git
    ```
2. Set up the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Profile Report**:
    To generate a profiling report for the dataset, use the following command:
    ```bash
    venv/bin/python3 ./src/profile.report.py
    ```

2. **Generate and View the Graph**:
    You can visualize the average temperature and feels-like temperature data over time using:
    ```bash
    venv/bin/python3 ./src/lib.py
    ```
